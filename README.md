My artist music quiz.

Few implementation notes:

1. The boilerplate was made by create-react-app. This was made to fasten up the creation and focus on the task itself.
2. I've decided to not do container/component seperation, as it a pretty simple app.
3. I've tried to make the game as generic and open to changes as possible, but it wasn't always possible without knowing the more generic requirments. That's why some things are working by constants and some are by value.
